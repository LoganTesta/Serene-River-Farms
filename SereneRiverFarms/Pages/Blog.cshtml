                    There's still time to pick up your pumpkins for Halloween.  We have an upcoming Pumpkin Tour this weekend on October 26
                    where visitors can get a guided tour of the pumpkin patch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Learn a bit about the process of growing quality pumpkins from one of our farmers and then pick out some pumpkins for your family!
                    There will be free hot apple cider too!
